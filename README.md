ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Viktor Atanasov.
- I am a front-end developer with a strong passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I have a solid foundation in the technical skills needed to bring designs to life, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to my work as a front-end developer, I am also deeply interested in artificial intelligence and am always looking for ways to incorporate new technologies into my projects. With my combination of technical expertise and creative vision, I am able to create websites that are not only functional but also truly beautiful to use.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming/Designing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
