My name is Viktor Atanasov. I am a **Full-Stack Javascript Developer** with a strong passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I have a solid foundation in the technical skills needed to bring designs to life, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also deeply interested in artificial intelligence and I am always looking for ways to incorporate new technologies into my projects.
